These scripts provide automated proofreading for English text:

1. spelling
2. "weasel words"
3. passive voice
4. duplicated words

The script 'proofread' aggregates all four functions into one tool.

These scripts can all take input from either stdin or file arguments.
Thus, they make useful companions for editors like vi and vim.

See the man pages for details.

Matt Might provided the original versions of items 2-4 here:

I have adapted these to my purposes, especially to support piping.
